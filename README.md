This is the Vue.js based client-side application for [latenight.blue](https://latenight.blue/).

## Production setup

After building, place the contents of `dist/` into the server `themeDir` directory, inside a directory that is the theme name. For example, assuming `themeDir` is set to `/lnb-server/static/`:

    /lnb-server
        /static
            /latenight.blue
                - dist contents
            /eleventhirty.am
                - dist contents

## Building

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
